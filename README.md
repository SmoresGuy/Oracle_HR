# Oracle_HR
This script creates the Oracle HR tables, indexes, views, constraints, triggers for the Training material on Oracle 11G forward.  I don't have any claim to ownership on this script, I just wanted to make it easier to find for others.  

This script will create the DB items, and load data into the tables for use.
